title: Emory Welcomes 2023 REU/RET Participants on Campus
date: 2023-06-13
summary: "We are thrilled to kick off our core REU/RET phase 2023 this week and to welcome our participants from all over the country to Emory's campus. The theme this year is data for social justice, and our five teams will investigate mathematical algorithms and computational tools to analyze data in a wide range of applications. In the next six weeks, they will work on their research projects, learn about cutting-edge developments in this area, and benefit many career development and mentoring opportunities."

This is an exciting week for us as we finally entered the  core phase of our 2023 REU/RET.
We are delighted to have a diverse and [talented group of participants](../../people/) joining us from different states and institutions. 
They will spend the next six weeks on Emory’s campus and will have access to state-of-the-art facilities, resources, and mentorship. 
We look forward to getting to know them and supporting them throughout this journey.

The theme of this year’s program is data for social justice and our five teams will explore various topics related to this theme from a mathematical perspective.
Our [projects](../../summer2023/) span topics motivated by health disparities, environmental justice, and fairness in deep learning. 
The participants will study and develop mathematical algorithms and computational tools to analyze and solve open challenges in these areas.
They will have plenty of opportunities to meet with their mentors and peers who will provide feedback and guidance.


In the next six weeks, our participants will not only work on their research projects, but also engage in a variety of activities that will enhance their skills and knowledge in data science.
Our weekly seminar and ad-hoc lectures will train participants in most aspects of mathematical research in this area and give advice on career development.

We are excited to kick off this program and look forward to a productive and fun summer with our participants!
