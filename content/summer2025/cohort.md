title : Cohort Activities
---

To facilitate interactions across the teams and interactions between participants and faculty, our site emphasizes cohort activities. Those activities include:

- a weekly project meeting with breakfast
- a weekly seminar with lunch
- ad-hoc seminars on background material (e.g., optimization, machine learning, PDEs, ...)
- social events 
- mid-term presentations 
- final poster session with poster awards
- many mentoring and advising opportunities (e.g., grad school and career panels, ...)

We involve participants in planning these activities and adapt them based on their background knowledge and project needs.
