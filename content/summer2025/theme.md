#  Models meet Data

Computational and data-enabled science has become the third pillar of science, completing theory and experimentation. Approaches within computational and data-enabled science may be categorized as model-based and data-driven. On the one hand, mathematical and physical models are powerful tools in modern data science to discover, analyze, and predict underlying mechanisms of real-world applications. The classical modeling approach was and still is driving many discoveries. Data-driven scientific approaches with the help of artificial intelligence and tools from machine learning, on the other hand, have advanced and influenced our daily lives in recent years.  Current state-of-the-art scientific methods merge both approaches to enhance discoveries through physics-informed and data-driven hybrid approaches.
