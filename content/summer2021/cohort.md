To facilitate interactions across the teams and interactions with other faculties, our site emphasizes cohort activities. Even though the program ran virtually this year, the mentors and participants engaged in various formats. We held daily writing labs, midterm presentations, ad-hoc talks on various topics, and social events. The latter were organized by the participants themselves who got really creative and organized different virtual events such as reversi and jack box games, movie nights, chopped night, hot-takes presentations etc.
