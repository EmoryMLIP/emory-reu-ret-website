# Learning From Images

The REU/RET program focused on computational mathematics for reconstructing, analyzing, segmenting, and generating images. The research work is a collaborative effort between a group of undergraduate students, in-service math teachers, and  mathematics faculty from Emory University. Four different research groups worked together on different projects under the theme “Learning from Images.” This provided undergraduate students and math teachers from around the nation numerous learning opportunities and a chance to conduct research in this area.  Teachers were involved in research and able to create teaching materials that they can use in their classroom.
