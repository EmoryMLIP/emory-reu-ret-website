## Social Consequences of AI in Health Care

Mentor: [Yuanzhe Xi](../author/yuanzhe-xi/)

In recent years, machine learning techniques are increasingly used in real-world, especially in medicine and healthcare. They have been praised for the great promise it offers but has also been at the center of heated controversy. Recent reports identify and point out the main clinical, social, and ethical risks posed by AI in healthcare. Specifically, potential errors and patient harm; risk of bias and increased health inequalities; lack of transparency and trust; and vulnerability to hacking and data privacy breaches. 

This summer, we aim to review the social consequences of AI models in healthcare and develop methods to minimize these risks and maximize the benefits of medical AI, such as increased transparency, explainability, and interpretability.
