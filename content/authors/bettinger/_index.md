Bree Ettinger is a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Mathematics at Emory University. Before joining Emory in 2013, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher in the MOX Laboratory for Modeling and Scientific Computing at the Politecnico di Milano. I worked on Statistical and Numerical methods for the Analysis of Problems in Life sciences and Engineering with my advisors Laura Sangalli and Simona Perotto. In 2009, I completed both a PhD in Mathematics and a Masters of Science in Statistics from the University of Georgia. My advisor was Min-Jun Lai and my dissertation developed a functional data analysis approach to predicting low-level ozone concentrations.  With her advisor, Dr. Lars Ruthotto, her research focuses on developing efficient deep learning algorithms for scientific applications.
