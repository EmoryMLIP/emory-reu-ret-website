## Contents: Emory CMDS REU/RET Website

This directory and its subdirectories contain the content that appears on our website. 
Each subdirectory corresponds to a page on the website. Below we give a quick overview over the folders that you might want to edit. 


## home

This folder contains the elements of our main website. It mostly draws content from other places (such as featured projects) but also contains some text that can be edited in welcome.md

## authors

The subdirectories in this folder contain information about the people involved on our site. If you see a folder with your name, you can maintain your picture and bio here. If you are new or do not have a folder already, 
 you can copy one existing folder that corresponds to your role (e.g, mentor, student, teacher, ...)

## projects

This folder contains the website for the individual projects. The participants will have to edit their folder and can add images, videos, PDFs, etc.
