# Information for Applicants

Our site provides several funded summer research opportunities for undergraduate students and in-service high-school teachers.
For summer 2024, applications can be submitted via [ETAP](https://etap.nsf.gov/award/5215/opportunity/6964).
We will begin reviewing applications on February 1 and all applications received by March 1 will receive full consideration. Until we finalize the roster (usually by early April) we will not decline qualified applicants.

We particularly encourage women, students from underrepresented groups, first-generation college students, and institutions where research programs in STEM are limited to apply.

## Eligibility

Students must be enrolled in an undergraduate program at a US institution during the summer. Unfortunately, this means that students graduating in the spring semester are not eligible. 

To be supported from our main grant, participants must be US citizens or permanent residents. We have some (albeit limited) additional funds to support international students. All participants must currently be enrolled at a US institution. 

We expect participants to be fully available in-person during our  REU phase and on campus for eight weeks during the summer. This year's program will be held from June 3 until July 26.

## Expectations and Pre-Requisites

The research projects are designed to be accessible to participants with a strong working knowledge in Linear Algebra, Vector Calculus, Differential Equations and elementary programming experience. This can either be from past courses, courses students are enrolled in during the Spring term, or from independent studies. To help participants learn other project-specific materials, our site includes a comprehensive research training plan and our mentors are experienced and accessible to explain more advanced materials.

Our activities include professional development, a weekly lunch seminar, and social dinners. Past participants have also often organized trips in the Atlanta area.


## Stipend Information

Supported students will receive a stipend of 5,600 USD, travel support of up to 800 USD to and from Emory, and free on-campus accommodations.

## Housing

Participants will be housed on Emoryâ€™s beautiful Clairmont Campus. You can find a full description of the facilities [here](https://sihp.emory.edu/housing/index.html). We share an application link in April so everyone can register on time. Ideally, participants should arrive on the Sunday before the start of the program and move out on the Saturday after the program.

Participants will generally be housed in 4-bedroom apartments. Every participant will have their own bedroom and bathrooms, kitchen, and living room will be shared. The SIHP will take care of room assignments. As much as possible, you will live with other students from this site but there may be one or two apartments that are mixed with summer students from other programs.
