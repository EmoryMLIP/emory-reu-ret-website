summary: 'Implicit networks are a special type of architecture whose outputs are defined by a fixed point (or optimality) condition. To evaluate these networks, one performs an iterative process, where each iteration is considered a layer of the network. The depth of these networks often vary depending on the complexity of the input data; for instance, in natural language processing, it might take 3 iterations (or layers) to output the sentiment of a simple sentence, but it might take 100 layers for the network to output the sentiment of a complicated sentence. Unfortunately, training implicit networks efficiently typically comes at additional computational cost. This project explores fast and efficient algorithms for training implicit networks, with emphasis on their applications to inverse problems.'

title: 'Comparing Reinforcement Learning to Optimal Control Methods on the Continuous Mountain Car Problem'

weight : 20
summary: 'In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) methods have shown success in solving optimal control problems involving ordinary differential equations. RL approaches differ drastically from traditional optimal control methods. Where prior methods have relied on the ODE models, RL tries to learn the optimal control simply by observing actions and rewards. There is tremendous activity in the sciences and engineering utilizing both methods. However, RL and optimal control theory is rarely compared on the same problem. This paper fills that gap and tries to investigate the trade-off between data-driven RL methods and model-driven optimal control methods on the continuous mountain car problem. We find that...'
