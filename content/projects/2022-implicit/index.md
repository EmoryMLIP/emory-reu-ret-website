summary: 'Given a computational model of some real world process in form of an ODE equation with some parameters you can control, how do you choose the control parameters to achieve a certain goal. For example, letâ€™s say you want to determine when to break or accelerate your car on a highway such that you minimize your travel time and also keep a safe distance. There are ample examples of problems like this and they be formulated and solved using the framework of optimal control. Model-based approaches (e.g., approaches that use the ODE) have been used very successfully in a wide range of science and engineering applications. However, in recent years success stories like that of AlphaGo and more recently AlphaFold have demonstrated the ability of reinforcement learning to find (almost) optimal controls using data instead of models. This REU project investigates the trade-off between model-based and data-driven approaches for several examples from the optimal control literature. To this end, we will study theoretical properties of both approaches and also perform numerical comparisons.'
