summary: 'Numerical models of coastal hydrodynamics play a vital role in understanding hurricane storm surges, particularly as the climate changes. However, uncertainties in model parameters and their representations, e.g., bottom stress and surface wind stress, limit the confidence of model results. Data is becoming increasingly available but also contains uncertainties. In this project we will explore methods of data assimilation, which utilize information about the uncertainties in both modeled and observed data to improve estimates of the coastal system state.'

## Glaciers
Research has shown that climate change will likely impact storm surge inundation and make modeling this process more difficult. Sea-level rise caused by climate change plays a part in this impact. To better model sea-level rise, glaciers can be modeled. Our group is collaborating with Dr. Robel from Georgia Tech and working with his glacier model. Marine-Terminating Glaciers have a natural flow towards the ocean, which contributes to sea level rise. By the year 2300, the Antarctic ice sheet is projected to cause up to [3 meters of sea level rise](https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA431965879&sid=googleScholar&v=2.1&it=r&linkaccess=abs&issn=00280836&p=HRCA&sw=w&userGroupName=anon%7Eed4bce0c) globally. Due to the severe impacts of glacial melting, modeling changes in ice sheets is an important task. There are challenges to modeling sea level rise, as ice sheet instability leads to significant sea-level rise uncertainty.

[Ice sheet models](https://doi.org/10.1029/2018JF004709) aim to describe the changes in ice mass of marine-terminating glaciers, which may be impacted over time by climate change.
