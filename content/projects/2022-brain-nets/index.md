summary: 'Orchestrating behavior and cognition, human brains lie at the core of complex neurobiological systems. Understanding of the structures, functions and mechanisms inside the brains has been an intriguing pursuit throughout human history. Recent studies in neuroscience and brain imaging have reached the consensus that the interactions among brain regions are driving factors for neural development and disorders, but there has not been an understanding in what mathematical models should be used to analyze such interactions, a.k.a the brain networks. In this project, we will explore and analyze different approaches for the modeling of brain networks, especially ranging from traditional shallow graph models to modern deep graph neural networks, towards the analysis of mental disorders, such as PTSD, depression and substance misuse. We will adapt different graph mining techniques for brain networks, statistically and visually analyze the results, and quantitatively evaluate them in the standard graph classification setting.'

## Overview

We are comparing and benchmarking the performance of graph kernels and graph neural networks on the classification of diseases from neuroimaging data. 

## Datasets

We are working with 2 datasets, each classifying HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) and BP (bipolar disorder). Each dataset consists of FMRI scans, DTI scans, and classification labels (diseased (-1)/ non-diseased (1)). Both datasets have been cleaned for us and consist of less than 100 patients. The DTI and FMRI brain scans of each patient $i$ are represented as weighted adjacency matrices $\mathbf{W}_i \in \mathbb{R}^{M \times M}$. FMRI scans are considered to be more robust than DTI scans, so our experiments prioritize working with them. Nodes in the brain network represent regions of interest (ROI), and edge links between nodes indicate the strength of
the connection between ROIâ€™s. For our data, we implemented a rounding scheme to remove edge weights and sparsify the adjacency matrices. We have: ...
We further manipulate the data to obtain a list of graph objects that can be used with the Python packages [GraKel](https://ysig.github.io/GraKeL/0.1a8/) and [PyG](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Classification Task

The standard graph classification task considers the problem of classifying graphs into two or more categories. The goal is to learn a model that maps graphs in the set of graphs $G$ to a set of labels $Y$.
