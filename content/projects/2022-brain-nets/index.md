summary: 'Orchestrating behavior and cognition, human brains lie at the core of complex neurobiological systems. Understanding of the structures, functions and mechanisms inside the brains has been an intriguing pursuit throughout human history. Recent studies in neuroscience and brain imaging have reached the consensus that the interactions among brain regions are driving factors for neural development and disorders, but there has not been an understanding in what mathematical models should be used to analyze such interactions, a.k.a the brain networks. In this project, we will explore and analyze different approaches for the modeling of brain networks, especially ranging from traditional shallow graph models to modern deep graph neural networks, towards the analysis of mental disorders, such as PTSD, depression and substance misuse. We will adapt different graph mining techniques for brain networks, statistically and visually analyze the results, and quantitatively evaluate them in the standard graph classification setting.'
