summary: 'The human brain sends signals using around 100 billion neurons connected in a complex and dynamic fashion. The sheer number of neurons makes the task of modeling, particularly at the network level, difficult. Instead of modeling each individual neuron, one can instead approximate the system using a series of coupled ordinary or delay differential equations. Using bifurcation theory, this approximate system can then be manipulated to mimic neuronal level changes that lead to neuronal dysfunction, disease states, and, ultimately, possible trajectories in parameter space that lead back to a healthy neuronal state. These types of models help add to the understanding of neuronal dysfunction but are pretty useless without data to validate the model. Fortunately, a rich dataset of in-vivo primate neuronal data recorded throughout various movement-related brain areas is available to help validate and corroborate findings for this project.'

# Mathematical Modeling of Healthy and Parkinsonian Firing Patterns in the Primate Thalamocortical Motor Circuit
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a slowly progressing neuro-degenerative disease characterized by impaired motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, muscular rigidity, and resting tremors.<sup>1</sup> In industrialized countries, PD affects 0.3% of all people and 1% of people over age 60.<sup>18</sup> The basal ganglia, motor thalamus, and motor cortex are three main components of the brain's motor circuit and are responsible for movement planning and execution; movement disorders such as PD can develop when the typical activity of this circuit is disrupted.<sup>2</sup> We employ a mathematical model to investigate the interactions between motor circuit components in normal and parkinsonian states, ultimately developing a deeper understanding of how PD presents itself in the brain.

# The Motor Circuit
The basal ganglia, thalmus, and cortex are members of numerous segregated circuits and subcircuits in the brain, including the motor circuit; disruption in the flow of this circuit can lead to Parkinson's disease.<sup>3</sup> The striatum and subthalamic nucleus (STN) function as input receptors in the motor circuit, receiving signals from the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the primary motor cortex (M1). This input passes through the direct and indirect pathways in the motor circuit.<sup>2</sup> The direct pathway is composed of the connection from the striatum to the GPi to the thalamus; the indirect pathway flows from the striatum to the globus pallidus external (GPe), from the GPe to the STN, from the STN to the GPi, and from the GPi to the thalamus.<sup>4,5</sup> After the input has passed through one of these pathways, the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) and the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) subsequently release output signals to the thalamus and brainstem.<sup>2</sup> These relationships are demonstrated in the simplified model below.

The main cause of PD is the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), which in turn results in decreased levels of dopamine in the striatum.<sup>^6</sup> This dopamine loss results in significant changes in the basal ganglia's neuronal activity, hence disrupting the motor circuit's overall flow and inhibiting the brain's ability to regulate bodily movement.<sup>2</sup> Other projects, such as the 2019 paper by M. Caiola and M. Holmes, have investigated the changes in the basal ganglia neuronal activity from a mathematical modeling perspective, but little research has been done on the parkinsonism-associated changes in the areas of the thalamus and cortex which are involved in the motor circuit.<sup>7</sup> Given the practical limitations associated with directly recording data concerning parkinsonian changes in neuronal activity in the thalamus and cortex, fitting a mathematical model to previously recorded data helps us to further investigate the effects of dopamine loss on thalamocortical neurons specifically.
# Individual Neuron Models
Many attempts to model the activity of neuron networks are reduced models, which seek to simulate the behavior of a large population of neurons using a much smaller group of individual neurons.<sup>8</sup> The most widely known of these individual neuron mathematical models is the Hodgkin-Huxley model,<sup>9</sup> which provides the following nonlinear system that simulates an individual neuron's action potential firing dynamics with high accuracy:<sup>10,11</sup>
