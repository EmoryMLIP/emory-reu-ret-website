summary: 'The human brain sends signals using around 100 billion neurons connected in a complex and dynamic fashion. The sheer number of neurons makes the task of modeling, particularly at the network level, difficult. Instead of modeling each individual neuron, one can instead approximate the system using a series of coupled ordinary or delay differential equations. Using bifurcation theory, this approximate system can then be manipulated to mimic neuronal level changes that lead to neuronal dysfunction, disease states, and, ultimately, possible trajectories in parameter space that lead back to a healthy neuronal state. These types of models help add to the understanding of neuronal dysfunction but are pretty useless without data to validate the model. Fortunately, a rich dataset of in-vivo primate neuronal data recorded throughout various movement-related brain areas is available to help validate and corroborate findings for this project.'

# Mathematical Modeling of Healthy and Parkinsonian Firing Patterns in the Primate Thalamocortical Motor Circuit
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a slowly progressing neuro-degenerative disease characterized by impaired motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, muscular rigidity, and resting tremors.<sup>1</sup> In industrialized countries, PD affects 0.3% of all people and 1% of people over age 60.<sup>18</sup> The basal ganglia, motor thalamus, and motor cortex are three main components of the brain's motor circuit and are responsible for movement planning and execution; movement disorders such as PD can develop when the typical activity of this circuit is disrupted.<sup>2</sup> We employ a mathematical model to investigate the interactions between motor circuit components in normal and parkinsonian states, ultimately developing a deeper understanding of how PD presents itself in the brain.
