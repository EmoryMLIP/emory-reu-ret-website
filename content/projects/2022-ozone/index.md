summary: 'Ground level ozone is a harmful air pollutant. Predicting low-level ozone can inform air quality forecasts and help people determine which outside activities are safe. Functional linear regression models have recently shown their ability to predict low levels of ozone. In this project, we will study functional models based on bivariate splines over triangulation to approximate the spatially distributed ozone measurements on a surface. We will focus not just on computing a forecast but also on quantifying the uncertainty associated with our predictions.'

Purpose Statement

The NSF RET Site Computational Mathematics for Data Science within the Department of Mathematics at Emory University research opportunities for high school held in conjunction with the Emory University Research Experience for Undergraduates in Atlanta, GA. This focuses on team building, on-demand teaching of advanced mathematical concepts, and finalizing the design of a research project inspired by the highly anticipated doctoral research findings of Bree Ettinger, Ph.D, Senior Lecturer of Mathematics at Emory University.  
Dr. Ettinger’s research, argued in her white paper entitled Uncertainty Quantification for Ozone Forecasting, teams will work on their research project, engage in weekly seminars, and receive mentorship, explores the global impacts of ground level ozone functioning as a harmful pollutant; its mathematical computational relevance in key areas around the United States (U.S.); and how Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data surfaces serve as catalysts for deep research into the methodologies needed to determine the critical eigenvalue and eigenvector elements for assessment of danger zones over discrete periods of time and in specific locations.  
Dr. Ettinger leads a team of hand - selected, highly qualified, culturally diverse U.S. K-12 Teachers hailing from urban educational centers nationwide assisting her in determining results oriented data outcomes using computational and data-enabled science completing her theories and experimentation with real - life application. Using the specificity of the models she’s investigated (and the amounts of data required), the team uses both model-based and data-driven approaches that advance theory and computation for numerical prediction seeking a consistent model that is mathematically and computationally viable for real - life problems in environmental sustainability. 
In her project, the team will develop mastery in data assimilation, calculate measurements to predict reliability in order to work toward creating new mathematical insight and designing of practical solutions through the range of mathematical techniques such as: machine learning, numerical linear algebra, optimization, partial differential equations, and statistics.  Mastery will be advanced with intensive studies on data and ethics, algorithmic bias and public scholarship.  They will also develop their team building skill sets, on - demand teaching of advanced mathematical concepts, and add unique conclusions to her preliminary research applying, 
Teacher Researchers
Ahngelique A. Davis 
Ahngelique A. Davis is a 7 - 12 Mathematics & Special Education Teacher integrating S.T.E.A.M. principles of higher order thinking to advance the real - life application of student theoretical mathematics.  Currently, a graduate student completing her Master of Science at the University of Pennsylvania, she’s translating the computational mathematics knowledge from its pure elements into a functional thought - process blending the vast number of approaches in this area through the specificity of the model and the amounts of data required for design learning within her classrooms.  Under Dr. Ettinger’s tutelage, Ms. Davis is honing her advanced mathematical calculations translations and strengthening her software research writing skills using tools such as Overleaf to articulate computational mathematical processes into literary formats using coding methods to upgrade her students’ math/science notebook presentation approaches.

Antonio Gamboa is a teacher who engages his students by presenting information in ways that empowers the learner with confidence to challenge difficult topics. He asks from them to think differently and to try with the knowledge that failure is acceptable and a key step on to achieve mastery. To feel and learn just like his students he regularly participates in summer programs to learn new and challenging subjects.  Before he became a teacher he was a research scientist in cancer prevention. At Emory University he is gladly continuing his long life learning story by challenging Mathematics, Statistics and Computational programming. All new topics that he has embraced in collaboration with his RET peer teachers. Gratefully, through the team collaboration he is now beginning to see how those topics lead to machine learning and the ability to make ground level Ozone predictions. Antonio enjoys swimming and Nature.
Ronnie Brown 
Ronnie Brown is a high school teacher at Bard High School Early College (BHSEC) - Baltimore. His educational background is in Industrial and Civil Engineering. Currently, he teaches Geometry, College Algebra, and Introductory Engineering at BHSEC. Ronnie’s current interests and ‘at-school’ research are in STEM Education through project based and experiential learning. During his time at the Emory University RET, he is learning and understanding more about computational mathematics and team research. Through this experience, he has encountered many new tools to share with his students as well as colleagues.
