Advances in the neuroimaging technology of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) have provided large amounts of digital data, which can be used to study the complex functionality of the human brain. A whole-brain fMRI image sample consists of a discrete-time series of 3D image scans, where each scan consists of hundreds of thousands of voxels. The size of the dataset and additional problems such as measurement noise render fMRI analysis very challenging computationally. The team will investigate the use of tensor representations to represent and analyze the fMRI data. Here, an fMRI brain image sample can be organized as a fourth-order tensor, with three space and one time dimension. This viewpoint allows for extracting information using various tensor decomposition methods.
