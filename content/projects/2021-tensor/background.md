A tensor is a multidimensional array of data. We denote tensors with a capital script letter $\mathcal{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{n_1\times \dots \times n_d}$.
There are many products associatedd with tensors including the mode
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{A} \times_k \mathbf{M} = \mathbf{M} \mathcal{A}_{(k)}
\end{equation}

Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) gives us pictures of the brain like the following:
