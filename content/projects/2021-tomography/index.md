# New algorithm helps make portable CT machine images clearer.
*Mathematics: College students and math teachers have developed a new, better way of improving image resolution with mathematical methods.* 

Research work done at the 2021 REU/RET summer program at Emory University has proven a way to make medical diagnoses more effectively. The work behind this new way relies heavily upon mathematical techniques that connect linear algebra with numerical and optimization methods. 

The research work done is a collaborative effort between a group of students and teachers. This truly has opened up numerous possibilities for the REU/RET Emory Program, which has been seeking to explore new approaches to analyze imaging data -for example, image reconstruction -to produce better quality images.   

Some of the most important aspects of this work focuses on setting up a linear least squares problem, to which the solution may be approximated  by  using  an alternating descent scheme known as block coordinate descent or (BCD). They also find the solution to the non-linear least squares problem by using imfil and the MATLAB function, lsqnonlin.  

The results obtained from their work have offered other students mathematicians a different way to study these problems and possibly radiology doctors an efficient way to accurately diagnose illnesses and keep saving patients' lives. This work has been one of the most interesting pieces of work ever accomplished because CT images in portable devices are a lot clearer. 



# Saving People’s Lives 
The 2021 REU/RET Emory program focuses on computational mathematics and its applications in data science.The research goal of the Point-of-Care Tomographic Imaging group is to develop numerical methods to jointly estimate the geometry parameters of portable CT scan devices to reconstruct an image. The mathematical ideas involved in this project are of great importance. With these mathematical methods, imaging becomes a possibility to patients in all parts of the world allowing them to live a healthy and happy life.   

The medical field depends greatly on imaging methods. In  medical  imaging,  computed  tomography  (CT)  techniques  are  becoming  more  and  more  popular  for  their ability to produce high quality images of the human body.  The COVID-19 pandemic brought challenges and setbacks to many doctors around the world  and imaging played a vital role in helping diagnose the virus. Doctors have been able to use CT scans to diagnose COVID-19, examine the lungs in patients, who were at high risk of infection, and those recovered from the virus.  

CT methods use a combination of computer processes and mathematics to reconstruct images. Many mathematicians have influenced this field of computed tomography, including Johann Radon; Allan McLeod Cormack and Godfrey Newbold Hounsfield developed the first scanning device.  

# Point-of-Care Tomographic Imaging

A CT scanner is a device that is composed of a scanning gantry, x-ray generator, computer system, console panel and a physician’s viewing console. The scanning gantry is the part that will produce and detect x-rays. In a typical CT scan, a patient lays on a bed that would move through the gantry. An X-ray tube rotates around the patient and shoots X-ray beams through the human body at different angles. These X-ray measurements are then processed on a computer using mathematical algorithms to create tomographic(cross-sectional) images of the tissues inside the body.

Two parameters that are associated with the geometry of portable CT scanning devices are: 1) R - distance between source and detector and 2) θ - orientation of source to detector. In point-of-care imaging, these parameters are essential during the data imaging process, as they may possibly change when the CT scanner is adjusted.

Portable Medical Machinery Powered by Mathematics

Computed tomography (CT) is well known for its ability to produce high-quality images needed for medical diagnostic purposes. Unfortunately, standard CT machines are extremely large, heavy, require careful and regular calibration, and are expensive, limiting their availability in many parts of the world. An alternative approach is to use portable machines. Still, parameters related to the geometry of these devices (e.g., the distance between source and detector, the orientation of the source to the detector) cannot always be precisely calibrated in point-of-care situations. These parameters may change slightly when the machine is adjusted during the image acquisition process, which causes severe degradations in the resulting image. The team working on this project will develop a numerical method to jointly estimate the geometry parameters of the portable device and to reconstruct the image.
